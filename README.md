Quantum Entanglement 

>> https://joenasriani.github.io/quantum-entanglement-game/

Quantum Entanglement is a browser-based puzzle game where you control two quantum particles simultaneously. Your goal is to guide both particles—Cyan and Magenta—to their respective target zones. The catch? They are entangled: moving one moves the other in the same direction, but the maze layout and phase walls affect them differently.

🎮 Game Features

40 Progressive Levels: Ranging from "Introductory" tutorials to "Grandmaster" and "Singularity" challenges.

Simultaneous Control: One input moves both particles unless a wall blocks specific paths.

Phase Walls:

Cyan Walls (dashed): Block only the Cyan particle.

Magenta Walls (dashed): Block only the Magenta particle.

Standard Walls: Block both.

Locking Mechanic: Once a particle reaches its goal, it locks in place, allowing you to maneuver the remaining particle independently to solve the puzzle.

Time Dilation (Undo): Made a mistake? Rewind time instantly with the Undo function.

Auto-Save: Your progress is automatically saved to your browser's local storage.

Mobile-First Design: Optimized for touch screens with a dedicated on-screen D-Pad, while maintaining full keyboard support for desktop.

🕹️ How to Play

Objective: Navigate the Cyan Particle (C) to the Cyan Goal and the Magenta Particle (M) to the Magenta Goal.

Movement: Use the arrow keys or on-screen D-Pad.

Entanglement: Both particles move in the same direction. Use walls to desynchronize their positions.

If the Cyan particle is blocked by a wall but the Magenta particle is free, only Magenta will move (and vice versa).

Winning: The level is complete when both particles are sitting on their respective goals simultaneously.

🧩 Level Zones

Levels 1-5 (Intro): Basic movement and phase walls.

Levels 6-15 (Intermediate): Navigation, asymmetry, and offsets.

Levels 16-25 (Expert): Complex polarization and symmetry breaking.

Levels 26-30 (Grandmaster): Tight spaces and precision alignment.

Levels 31-40 (Singularity): The ultimate test of parity and planning.
